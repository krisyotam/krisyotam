  <summary><strong>My Philosophy</strong></summary>

  "Everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler." This mantra drives my work. I believe in simplicity, clarity, and frugality in design. My goal is to create software that prioritizes usability and performance, designed for experienced users who value simplicity and efficiency.

  I view complexity as the enemy of good software. By stripping away unnecessary features and focusing on the core purpose, I aim to craft software that is not only easy to maintain but also fast, secure, and sustainable. True progress is achieved through intentional subtraction, where each decision is made with purpose, and every line of code has meaning.

  My work is rooted in the belief that simplicity is the key to ingenuity. Software should empower users, respect their privacy, and prioritize functionality over form.
